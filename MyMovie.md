My favorite movie of all time is probably Avengers Infinity War. is it a perfect movie? no it has flaws for sure, the pacing, 
some of the character decisions.it isn't the best movie ever made objectively speaking from a directing and filmic perspectives
but it's my favorite movie because of what it represents the culmination of years of build up and foreshadowing that goes back
far longer than any 1 movie could possible give for context. <\br>
